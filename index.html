But to someone watching you from far away, they‚Äôd never actually see you cross the edge. You‚Äôd just slow down, get redder and dimmer, and then freeze at the event horizon for eternity. So in a way‚Ä¶ there‚Äôs a version of you that would be stuck on the edge of a black hole forever, while you are long gone inside. Two versions of you existing at once, depending on who‚Äôs looking. crazy right? well, i hope there is some other version of us out there who is together. i cannot ask you or command you to do anything now, since youre not mine, unfortunately, BUT a request that.... idk, but yea just dont forget me or this phase, alr? please? cus i really wanna do all the sttuff we told we will do, but in jannah, so please, bbg. anyways, hope you liked the space fact. i know im not great at expressing emotions and this wish is no where near to your wish (i was about to cry in plane) but i have tried my best for you to like it. so, 3 more days ahahahah, finally is chutiye se chutkara mil jayega. but i really am honoured to have spend this era with you, to be loved by you. jappy birthday again, madiha. enjoy your day. ‚ù§Ô∏è</p>
